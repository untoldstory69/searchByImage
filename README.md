# searchByImage

A simple automated script to search images in Google and then compare the image with the search result.
The following technology are used:
-	IDE: Eclipse
-	Automation Framework: Selenium Webdriver
-	Programming Language: Java
-	Testing Framework: TestNG
-	Browser: Firefox
-	Driver: Gecko driver
-	External Jars: common-io, selenium, toolkit

I used a relative path in my script. The script can be executed from a remote system. 
The image file to be searched, the screenshot, and the resulting image are saved in the configuration folder.
The comparison between two images is done pixel-wise and the script prints the total differences in pixels.
